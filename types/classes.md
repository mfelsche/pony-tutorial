# Classes

Just like other object-oriented languages, Pony has __classes__. A class is declared with the keyword `class`, and it has to have a name that starts with a capital letter, like this:

```pony
class Wombat
```

__Do all types start with a capital letter?__ Yes! And nothing else starts with a capital letter. So when you see a name in Pony code, you will instantly know whether it's a type or not.

## What goes in a class?

A class is composed of:

1. Fields.
2. Constructors.
3. Functions.

### Fields

These are just like fields in C structs or fields in classes in C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, or basically any language, really. There are three kinds of fields: `var`, `let`, and `embed` fields. A `var` field can be assigned to over and over again, but a `let` field is assigned to in the constructor and never again. Embed fields will be covered in more detail in the documentation on [variables](../expressions/variables.md).

```pony
class Wombat
  let name: String
  var _hunger_level: U64
```

Here, a `Wombat` has a `name`, which is a `String`, and a `_hunger_level`, which is a `U64` (an unsigned 64-bit integer).

__What does the leading underscore mean?__ It means something is __private__. A __private__ field can only be accessed by code in the same type. A __private__ constructor, function, or behaviour can only be accessed by code in the same package. We'll talk more about packages later.

### Constructors

Pony constructors have names. Other than that, they are just like constructors in other languages. They can have parameters, and they always return a new instance of the type. Since they have names, you can have more than one constructor for a type.

Constructors are introduced with the __new__ keyword.

```pony
class Wombat
  let name: String
  var _hunger_level: U64

  new create(name': String) =>
    name = name'
    _hunger_level = 0

  new hungry(name': String, hunger': U64) =>
    name = name'
    _hunger_level = hunger'
```

Here, we have two constructors, one that creates a `Wombat` that isn't hungry, and another that creates a `Wombat` that might be hungry or might not.

__What's with the single quote thing, i.e. name'?__ You can use single quotes in parameter and local variable names. In mathematics, it's called a _prime_, and it's used to say "another one of these, but not the same one". Basically, it's just convenient.

Every constructor has to set every field in an object. If it doesn't, the compiler will give you an error. Since there is no `null` in Pony, we can't do what Java, C# and many other languages do and just assign either `null` or zero to every field before the constructor runs, and since we don't want random crashes, we don't leave fields undefined (unlike C or C++).

Sometimes it's convenient to set a field the same way for all constructors.

```pony
class Wombat
  let name: String
  var _hunger_level: U64
  var _thirst_level: U64 = 1

  new create(name': String) =>
    name = name'
    _hunger_level = 0

  new hungry(name': String, hunger': U64) =>
    name = name'
    _hunger_level = hunger'
```

Here, every `Wombat` begins a little bit thirsty, regardless of which constructor is called.

### Functions

Functions in Pony are like methods in Java, C#, C++, Ruby, Python, or pretty much any other object oriented language. They are introduced with the keyword `fun`. They can have parameters like constructors do, and they can also have a result type (if no result type is given, it defaults to `None`).

```pony
class Wombat
  let name: String
  var _hunger_level: U64
  var _thirst_level: U64 = 1

  new create(name': String) =>
    name = name'
    _hunger_level = 0

  new hungry(name': String, hunger': U64) =>
    name = name'
    _hunger_level = hunger'

  fun hunger(): U64 => _hunger_level

  fun ref set_hunger(to: U64 = 0): U64 => _hunger_level = to
```

The first function, `hunger`, is pretty straight forward. It has a result type of `U64`, and it returns `_hunger_level`, which is a `U64`. The only thing a bit different here is that no `return` keyword is used. This is because the result of a function is the result of the last expression in the function, in this case, the value of `_hunger_level`.

__Is there a `return` keyword in Pony?__ Yes. It's used to return "early" from a function, i.e. to return something right away and not keep running until the last expression.

The second function, `set_hunger`, introduces a _bunch_ of new concepts all at once. Let's go through them one by one.

* The `ref` keyword right after `fun`

This is a __reference capability__. In this case, it means the _receiver_, i.e. the object on which the `set_hunger` function is being called, has to be a `ref` type. A `ref` type is a __reference type__, meaning that the object is __mutable__. We need this because we are writing a new value to the `_hunger_level` field.

__What's the receiver reference capability of the `hunger` method?__ The default receiver reference capability if none is specified is `box`, which means "I need to be able to read from this, but I won't write to it".

__What would happen if we left the `ref` keyword off the `set_hunger` method?__ The compiler would give you an error. It would see you were trying to modify a field and complain about it.

* The `= 0` after the parameter `to`

This is a __default argument__. It means that if you don't include that argument at the call site, you will get the default argument. In this case, `to` will be zero if you don't specify it.

* What does the function return?

It returns the _old_ value of `_hunger_level`.

__Wait, seriously? The _old_ value?__ Yes. In Pony, assignment is an expression rather than a statement. That means it has a result. This is true of a lot of languages, but they tend to return the _new_ value. In other words, given `a = b`, in most languages, the value of that is the value of `b`. But in Pony, the value of that is the _old_ value of `a`.

__...why?__ It's called a "destructive read", and it lets you do awesome things with a capabilities-secure type system. We'll talk about that later. For now, we'll just mention that you can also use it to implement a _swap_ operation. In most languages, to swap the values of `a` and `b` you need to do something like:

```pony
var temp = a
a = b
b = temp
```

In Pony, you can just do:

```pony
a = b = a
```

### Finalisers

Finalisers are special functions. They are named `_final`, take no parameters and have a receiver reference capability of `box`. In other words, the definition of a finaliser must be `fun _final()`.

The finaliser of an object is called before the object is collected by the GC. Functions may still be called on an object after its finalisation, but only from within another finaliser. Messages cannot be sent from within a finaliser.

Finalisers are usually used to clean up resources allocated in C code, like file handles, network sockets, etc.

## What about inheritance?

In some object-oriented languages, a type can _inherit_ from another type, like how in Java something can __extend__ something else. Pony doesn't do that. Instead, Pony prefers _composition_ to _inheritance_. In other words, instead of getting code reuse by saying something __is__ something else, you get it by saying something __has__ something else.

On the other hand, Pony has a powerful __trait__ system (similar to Java 8 interfaces that can have default implementations) and a powerful __interface__ system (similar to Go interfaces, i.e. structurally typed).

We'll talk about all that stuff in detail later.

## Naming rules

By now it shouldn't be very surprising to learn that Pony is written in __ASCII__. [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) is a standard text encoding that uses English characters and symbols, and almost every programming language in existence defines source code as a subset of it.

A Pony type, whether it's a class, actor, trait, interface, primitive, or type alias, must start with an uppercase letter. After an underscore for private or special _methods_ (behaviors, constructors, and functions), any method or variable, including parameters and fields, must start with a lowercase letter. In all cases underscores in a row or at the end of a name are not allowed, but otherwise, any combination of letters and numbers is legal.

In fact, numbers may use single underscores inside as a separator too! But only valid variable names can end in primes.
